begin automatically opening file and closing file (idiomatic and easy to understand...going line by line)
  Maybe single column with name by name and have them build a list
  Build from that example
  Remind them it is read in as a string to whatever the thing is (can include try/except block)
  How to deal with headers
  Perhaps look at reading in binary data...maybe not critical
slurping and dumping files all at one time
splitting and joining files; csv, xls, tab delimited, etc.
Parsing out files to JSON, etc.
Maybe a small project to get data out of a website (or something to that effect) 
Potentially build a list of attributes leading into a simple class or objects...or something to effect 


Very rough outline.  Need to get teh actually txt, csv and excel filess for students to use.  Also need determine the application portion (which should tie into discussions with basic Python, advanced python, and OOP) and be able to provide students with the bare bones structure so they can incorporate it in the class without downloading anything (hopefully)
