	<h5>Activity</h5>
	Make lists of main dishes, side dishes, and drinks. (beef, pork, goat, sheep, chicken, fish); (akple, kenkey/dokonu, fufu, omo tuo); (water, juice, soda).

	<h5>Why Object Oriented Programming</h5>
	<ul>
	<li>Common data and functions (inheritance)</li><li>Protect data (encapsulation)</li></ul>
	<aside class="notes" block="markdown">
	Say I run a restaurant where I have several employees that have the same set of attributes that I care about; perform similar tasks; get paid certain amounts; etc. It is convenient to have template code that each instance (employee) can inherit quickly and I can reuse.
	At the end of this I will make you all determine objects for a real-world problem.

	<h5>Overview of OOP Terminology</h5>
	<p>Reference tutorialspoint</p>
	<ul>
		<li><b>Class:</b>A user-defined prototype for an object.</li>
		<li><b>Inheritance:</b>The creation of an instance of a class.</li>
		<li><b>Instance:</b>An individual object of a certain class.</li>
	</ul>

	<aside class="notes" block="markdown">
	 	<li><b>Class:</b>A user-defined prototype for an object that gives the object some attributes defined for any object of the class. The attributes are data members (class variables and instance variables) and methods. Methods are accessed via dot programming notation.</li>
		<li><b>Inheritance:</b>The creation of an instance of a class.</li>
		<li><b>Instance:</b>An individual object of a certain class. An object obj that belongs to a class Circle, for example, is an instance of the class Circle.</li>
		<li><b>Instantiation:</b>The creation of an instance of a class.</li>
		<li><b>Method:</b>A special kind of function that is defined in a class definition.</li>
		<li><b>Object:</b>A unique instance of a data structure that's defined by its class. An object comprises both data members (class variables and instance variables) and methods.</li>
	</aside>

<section>

	<h5>Creating Classes</h5>
	<p>The <i>class</i> syntax will create a new class. The name of the class is preceeded immediately by the keyword class</p>
	{% highlight py %}
class ClassName:
	#Optional class documentation string
	class_suite
	{% endhighlight %}

	<aside class="notes" block="markdown">
		class: ClassName
		Inheritance: class_suite
	</aside>

	<h5>Employee Class Example</h5>
	{% highlight python %}
class Employee:
   #Common base class for all employees
   empCount = 0 #this is a class variable accessed by Employee.empCount

   def __init__(self, name, salary):
      #this is the class constructor/initialization method called
      #when an instance is created
      self.name = name
      self.salary = salary
      Employee.empCount += 1

   def displayCount(self):
     #all methods start with self as an argument;however, when
     #you call a method python adds self to your list
     print "Total Employee %d" % Employee.empCount

   def displayEmployee(self):
      print "Name : ", self.name,  ", Salary: ", self.salary
	 {% endhighlight %}

	<aside class="notes" block="markdown">
	 	<li><b>Class:</b>A user-defined prototype for an object that gives the object some attributes defined for any object of the class. The attributes are data members (class variables and instance variables) and methods. Methods are accessed via dot programming notation.</li>
		<li><b>Inheritance:</b>The creation of an instance of a class.</li>
		<li><b>Instance:</b>An individual object of a certain class. An object obj that belongs to a class Circle, for example, is an instance of the class Circle.</li>
		<li><b>Instantiation:</b>The creation of an instance of a class.</li>
		<li><b>Method:</b>A special kind of function that is defined in a class definition.</li>
		<li><b>Object:</b>A unique instance of a data structure that's defined by its class. An object comprises both data members (class variables and instance variables) and methods.</li>
	</aside>
</section>

<section>
	<h5>Creating an object instance</h5>
	<p>Simply create instances of a class by calling the class name and passing whatever arguements __init__ accepts</p>
	{% highlight python %}
#Create an Employee named Carl with a salary of 20
emp1 = Employee("Carl",20)
	{% endhighlight %}
</section>

<section>
	<h5>Using a class</h5>
	<p>You can invoke an internal method of an instantiated object using the dot operator</p>
	{% highlight python %}
#This executes print Name : , self.name,  , Salary: , self.salary
emp1.displayEmployee()
print "total Employee %d" % Employee.empCount
	{% endhighlight %}

</section>

<section>
	<h5>Going beyond the basics</h5>
	<ul>
		<li>Adding an attribute e.g. emp1.age = 7</li>
		<li>Modifying an attribute e.g. emp1.age = 8</li>
		<li>Deleting an attribute e.g. del emp1.age</li>
		<br>
		<li>Can also use getattr(obj.name[, default]) to acess the attribute</li>
		<li>hasattr(obj,name) to check if an attribute exists</li>
		<li>setattr(obj,name,value) to set an attribute. This creates an attribute if it doesnt exist</li>
		<li>delattr(obj,name) to delete an attribute.</li>
	</ul>
</section>

<section>
	<h5>Python Built-Ins</h5>
	<p>Python builds in
	<ul>
	<li>__dict__ dictionary containing class namespace</li>
	<li>__doc__ documentation string</li>
	<li>__module__ name in which class is defined</li>
	</ul></p>
	<a href="showBuiltins.py">Example</a>
</section>
<section>
	<h5>Inheritance and Subclassing</h5>
	<p>In many programs it will be useful to have parent classes that can be used in child classes. The new, child class will inherit the methods and attributes of its parents class. Additionally, the child may include overrides. Let's look at an example.</p>
	{% highlight python %}
class SubClassName (ParentClass1[,ParentClass2, ...]):
	#Optional class documentation string#
	class_suite
	{% endhighlight %}
	<p>Derived classes are written similar to their base classes</p>
</section>

<section>
	{% highlight python %}
class Employee:
    'Common base for all employees'
    empCount = 0

    def __init__(self, name, salary, isWorking):
        self.name = name
        self.salary = salary
        self.isWorking = isWorking
        Employee.empCount += 1

class Cook(Employee):
    'Common base for all cooks'
    cookCount

    def __init__(self,name,salary,isWorking, specialty):
        Employee.__init__(self,name, salary,isWorking)
        self.specialty=specialty
        Cook.cookCount += 1

    def displayCook(self):
        print "Name: ", self.name, ", Salary: ", self.salary, ", Is Working: ", self.isWorking, ", Specialty: ", self.specialty

cook1 = Cook("bob", "salary", False, "specialty")
cook1.displayCook()
emp1 = Employee(“emp1”, “salary”, False)
emp1.displayCook()
	{% endhighlight %}

</section>
<section>
	<p>Overriding methods can be useful</p>
	{% highlight python %}
class Vector:
   def __init__(self, a, b):
      self.a = a
      self.b = b

   def __str__(self):
      return 'Vector (%d, %d)' % (self.a, self.b)

   def __add__(self,other):
      return Vector(self.a + other.a, self.b + other.b)

v1 = Vector(2,10)
v2 = Vector(5,-2)
print v1 + v2 #This prints 'Vector(7,8)'
	{% endhighlight %}

</section>
<section>
<h5>Override Example</h5>
Write an override that compares two Vectors to see if they are the same by comparing the coordinates.
