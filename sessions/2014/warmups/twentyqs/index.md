title: Twenty Questions Warmup
---

Engage class concerning 20 questions.  Is this a game that Ghanaians are familiar with?

Play the classic version of it with class, let each student ask a question until all students get a chance or answer guessed.

Then look at http://www.20q.net/

Ah, the game has been automated.  How is that possible?  

Could you automate the game of 20 questions using control structures such as for, while, if, etc.?

What on earth is a artificial neural net (ANN)?

Naturally, libraries have been made for it in Python.  The best known is [PyBrain](http://pybrain.org/).

Neural nets belong to a very specialized branch of computer science called machine learning.  ANNs were at first overhyped until their limitations were known.  Research, some of it quite successful, is ongoing.
