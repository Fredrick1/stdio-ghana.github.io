# This program does the work of a Host at a restaurant
# It should greet a customer, find out the size of the party, and
# let the customer know if a table is available,
# otherwise, the customer should be added to a waiting list

# Original Table status -- DO NOT CHANGE!

# Check if this party will fit with the table 9 availability
# If yes - let them know they will be seated
# If no - let them know how long they must wait
