###The Method of This Course

<aside class="notes" markdown="block">
What would we doing in a typical day in one of your other classes?

Make clear our expectations in this class:

- "audience" questions will asked regularly: you need to try to answer, and be honest
about your knowledge; okay to be wrong, not okay to try to hide it
- the instructors will disagree: most of these points, there isn't a "right"
answer
- there will be lots of doing
- speak up!
- lots of team activity - make sure to participate, and to work with others
(not for them, nor them working for you)
