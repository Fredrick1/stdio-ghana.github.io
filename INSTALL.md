#SETTING UP MACHINES FOR COURSE

1. Use Ubuntu 14.04.  Best to probably burn a DVD with the iso, and install from there:
`wget http://releases.ubuntu.com/14.04/ubuntu-14.04-desktop-i386.iso`
2. Default options should all be fine.
3. Once up and running, use the terminal for the following:
~~~ bash
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get upgrade
wget -q -O - http://archive.getdeb.net/getdeb-archive.key | sudo apt-key add -
sudo sh -c 'echo "deb http://archive.getdeb.net/ubuntu trusty-getdeb apps" >> /etc/apt/sources.list.d/getdeb.list'
sudo add-apt-repository ppa:eugenesan/ppa
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install git smartgit pycharm ruby1.9.1-dev nodejs
sudo gem install jekyll kramdown
~~~

For smartgit and pycharm, you may instead want to download those images once,
burn them to a dvd, and then install from the disk rather than download the few
hundred meg installers several times.

~~~ bash
sudo apt-get install python3-pytest python3-pytest-instafail
~~~

#Tom's Notes

To get Jekyll running on a clean Ubuntu 14.04 install, open up a
terminal and enter the following.  Lines starting with # are comments and don't
need to be entered.
~~~
# Install git and the ruby dev packages
sudo apt-get install git ruby1.9.1-dev  

# Install jekyll and kramdown, a particular markdown parser we're using
sudo gem install jekyll kramdown  

# Assuming you're already in a good place to put the STDIO Ghana stuff:
git clone https://github.com/pearsonca/stdio-ghana.git  

# Now change to the directory that was just created by the last command
cd stdio-ghana  

# Start up the Jekyll server
jekyll serve --watch --baseurl ""  

# Now open up a web browser, type localhost:4000 in the location bar.
# You have arrived.

#Carl Notes
On OSX 10.9, clang is configured to hard crash on options it doesn't understand.
There's an interesting discussion as to whether that makes sense or not, but to
deal with this for `gem (install|update)`s that require building something:
~~~ bash
ARCHFLAGS="-Wno-error=unused-command-line-argument-hard-error-in-future" sudo -E gem update jekyll
~~~

the `ARCHFLAGS` part is essentially telling clang to not hard crash.  The `-E`
argument to `sudo` is saying to use that environment variable.


#Jonathon's Notes

The latest version of Jekyll requires a version of Ruby that is newer than what
come pre-loaded on Ubunut 14.04.  I went round and round on this and can't
remember the steps or what actually worked.  I think gem might also have been
needed.  I am pretty sure the command "sudo apt-get install ruby1.9.3" did
something positive for my system, but your milage might vary.

Jekyll documentation should be looked at prior to use:
http://jekyllrb.com/docs/usage/ The jekyll build and serve options described
work well, but do not proscribe to my intuitive sense.  This resulted in
complete deletion of my local git repository and creating a local website out of
my entire home directory.  Fortunately, the error was easily-ish rectified.

SmartGit has a java dependency and an OOB Unbuntu install is not java-aware,
even though java is loaded.  Again, I went around and around on this and am
unsure what actually worked.  You might want to try "sudo update-alternatives
--config java"  and look at this
http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~help/unix_linux/ubuntu_java.html

PyCharm was the most trouble free.  You just unpack the .gz file into your home
directory.  There are more complex instructions if you want to install it to a
usr or opt. I didn't do this, but we might want to for the student machines.  I
think there is a java dependency, but I didn't run into the issue once SmartGit
was loaded.

#Seifu's Notes

To make jekyll work on Windows 7 is a little bit of a pain. You need to make sure that you install only
* Python 2.5 or later (not Python 3!)
* Ruby 1.9.3 (not earlier or later)
* Ruby DevKit 1.9.3
Those can be found at http://rubyinstaller.org/downloads/ and https://www.python.org/download/

The first step is to make sure that Python and Ruby are in your Environment Path. You can check this on a CommandPromt via
~~~
echo %PATH%
~~~
Or by right clicking on MyComputer and going to properties > Advanced system settings > Environment variables

To test that the PATH is setup correctly in a CommandPrompt try running python and ruby by typing

~~~
python
ruby
~~~

Once python  and ruby are installed you need to go to the directory that you
installed the DevKit in. I suggest you put it in a directory called something
like C:\DevKit and run the following:

~~~
cd C:\DevKit
ruby dk.rb init
ruby dk.rb install
~~~

Now you need to install jekyll and kramdown

~~~
gem install jekyll kramdown
~~~

Now you can cd to the git repo and serve from there

~~~
cd C:\Users\Documents\GitHub\stdio-ghana
jekyll serve
~~~

Note that in your browser you need to go to http:\\localhost:4000\stdio-ghana


#Dane's Notes

Tom's instructions are spot on above, with one exception. I used the 32-bit
Ubuntu 14.04 OOB and when I attempted to run Jekyll, it failed due to missing a
JavaScript runtime for Ruby. Apparently, there are several runtimes that will
work. I chose Node.js because it's fairly well-known.

~~~
sudo apt-get install -y nodejs
~~~

After this, the server was up and running with no problem.

Comment: It appears that links for the site are absolute vice relative. Clicking
any link in the local jekyll-hosted site actually just sends you out to the main
git.io site.  For testing, you need to edit the URLs directly.
