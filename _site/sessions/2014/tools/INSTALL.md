for the git exercise:

we're going to make a class roster, and demonstrate the concept of working in
parallel

- log into github
- go to stdio-ghana/stdio-ghana.github.io (official course website)
- fork repository
- clone to your machine
- edit the _students/ directory to add a markdown file for you (use the demo.md
  as a baseline)
- initiate a pull request: update your fork, then issue a pull request from it
