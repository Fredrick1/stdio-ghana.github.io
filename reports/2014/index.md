###Notes

- lodging students in residence hall: appears to improve attendance / attrition
- otoh, lodging the instructors there as well doesn't seem to be the right
choice; less reliable infrastructure has made it difficult to do evening support
work.
- getting lab space configured was very difficult, lab machines still have
incomplete network access.
- many more students than anticipated; course requires lots of individual
attention
