###Notes

- lodging students in residence hall: appears to improve attendance / attrition
- otoh, lodging the instructors there as well doesn't seem to be the right
choice; less reliable infrastructure has made it difficult to do evening support
work.
- getting lab space configured was very difficult, lab machines still have
incomplete network access.
- many more students than anticipated; course requires lots of individual
attention
- using the vm images was definitely the right approach.  HOWEVER, need to pay
more attention to making the right image.  For example, should have put our
program icons on task bar (and removed inane ones), double checked all the
activities for installation of proper libraries, disabled updates (maybe; alt:
found way to locally distribute any updates that came up during course)
