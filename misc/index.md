##For Accepted Applicants

If you have been accepted to the course, we will send you an email from the
stdio {dot} ghana {at} gmail {dot} com address.

For the course, you should pre-establish a [GitHub](http://github.com) account
and email us the username.

The course will be held in the University of Ghana Computing Systems Center, and
lodging provided in Francis Sey Hall.  Directions from Francis Sey to the UGCS
are available [here](https://goo.gl/maps/YVqLg), though there are some obvious
detours to take from the main roads to speed up the walk.  The class starts
promptly at 9 AM and runs until 5 PM in the evening.

During the course, we will use the lab computers exclusively during the day (no
personal computers are necessary, or should be brought to the lab).  These will
have Ubuntu 14.04 with [PyCharm](http://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/) and
[SmartGitHg](http://www.syntevo.com/smartgithg/) installed.

You may of course work on your personal machines outside the classroom.  If you
wish to familiarize yourself in advance with those pieces of software, they are
free and cross-platform, so you should be able to install them most anywhere.
We will not be doing any in-class troubleshooting of personal machines, but the
first evening's social event will be some troubleshooting of personal setup with
the instructors.
