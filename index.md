The STDIO Ghana course is a two-week, intensive program to provide practical
software engineering experience to undergraduate and graduate students, with
specific emphasis on addressing scientific and engineering research software
projects in sub-Saharan Africa.

The objective of the course is to introduce students to (1) a disciplined approach
to producing software and (2) self-directed learning and development skills, so
that they are (3) prepared to usefully support research with a software development
component.  The course also includes practical training in Python, and the team
projects are completed in Python.

The course is held in Ghana, at the University of Ghana in
Accra, in the summer shortly after the end of the academic year.  The
2014 course starts on June 9th, with the instructors arriving a few
days earlier to ensure the facilities are properly set up.
