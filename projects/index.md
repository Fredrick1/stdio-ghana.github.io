For 2014, our focus theme is Hospital Administration.  The students formed five
teams, and then were assigned to five areas.  Those areas and their associated
repositories are listed below:

- [Public Health Reporting](https://github.com/stdio-ghana/public-health-group)
- [Laboratory Testing](https://github.com/stdio-ghana/laboratory-group)
- [Pharmacy](https://github.com/stdio-ghana/pharmacy-group)
- [Employee Management](https://github.com/stdio-ghana/employee-group)
- [Patient Management](https://github.com/stdio-ghana/patient-group)
